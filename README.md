# TestSubject API

This API is a way to learn how to use and improve my knowledge about many things like:
- RestAPIs;
- GraphQL;
- PostgreSQL;
- Typescript;
- TypeORM;
- Express;
- Middlewares;

# How to Use


To use this API, first you need to run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

Change the parameters from `ormconfig.ts` at `src\ormconfig.ts`.

And run the SQLs from `database-setup.sql` to create the tables and relationships.

## More info
See [TypeORM Entities](https://typeorm.io/entities) to understand more about the called entities on models.
